Quick and Dirty Gui to test out CompressedLists

The performance package also includes Code to compare the performance of compressed lists vs Orc.  So far tests have found that CompressedLists is 50% to 200% faster depending on the data set with often comparable compression.  Parsing CompressedLists files is also over an order of magnitude faster than parsing CSV files.
